# 26 -- More Beautiful APIs

## Description

APIs that require Authentication are a little harder to use than those that don't, but by authenticating a guest, you can create, edit, and delete resources on behalf of that person, which makes the APIs even _more_ useful. Between [Hello JS](http://adodson.com/hello.js/) and [Firebase](http://firebase.com), you can authenticate with many of the third-party services like Github, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
