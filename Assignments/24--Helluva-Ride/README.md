# 24 -- One Helluva Ride

## Description

You've come a long way since that first week. Right now, you're dirty, tired, and worn-out, but just on the other side of this tunnel is Angular JS and full-blown application development. Hang tight.

### Choose Your Own Assignment

There are a handful of assignments from the last few weeks that should stand out:

* **[Responsive Vertical Timeline](/Assignments/06--Now-With-More-Responsive/README.md)**
* **[Surf & Paddle RWD](/Assignments/08--Surf-and-Paddle-RWD/README.md)**
* **[String Calculator](/Assignments/12--Coding-Dojo-Style/README.md#string-calculator-kata)**
* **[Check Writing](/Assignments/12--Coding-Dojo-Style/README.md#check-writing-kata-lite)**
* **[API Gymnastics](/Assignments/13--Lists%2BDicts/README.md#api-gymnastics)**
* **[A Nice Game of Chess](/Assignments/16--Nice-Game-of-Chess/README.md)**
* **[Github Revolution](/Assignments/20--Github-Revolution/README.md**

Redo all of these.

Put them in their own folders, named as per the **Requirements**, but make your own rules and checkpoints for them. Use whatever tools you think will help you or challenge you. Pace yourself. Work with others. Review your notes. Look at your old code on Github, if it helps. _Write your own code._

### Show me yo' moves!

Let's practice deploying to `gh-pages` as if it were the staging environment on a _real_ project. As you complete each piece of the assignment, push your work to Github _and_ push your branch to your `gh-pages` branch.

After you confirm your deployment, open a PR from your feature branch to your `master` branch and solicit feedback from your peers. Convert their feedback and any known issues you find into a checklist in the description of the PR. Add commits to check things off your list and get your 2x:+1:'s!

Once approved, merge that bad boy but _keep the branch!_ Do some more work on the _next_ piece, push to that branch again, update your `gh-pages` branch, and open _another_ PR to `master` for review. Rinse lather repeat.

Remember to link _each_ of your PRs to your _WIP Issue_!
