# 27 -- Getting Things Saved

## Description

COntinue working on your `TIY-Mashup` project in groups. If you need to use an API that requires authentication, you can use [Hello JS](http://adodson.com/hello.js/) _or_ [Firebase Auth](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/user-auth.html). If you need to store information outside of the APIs you're mashing, [the Firebase Web API](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/) is a great choice, but it can be challenging. Review [these recipes](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/recipes.html) and [example apps](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/examples.html) from the Firebase Documentation for ideas and reference... But don't ignore [the API docs!](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/api/)

### BEAST MODE

Wanna use an API that needs a middleman proxy (usually OAuth 1.0A)...? [Heroku](http://heroku.com) is a deployment target for Node JS apps that's free to use for pet projects. Start with [the intro guide for Node JS](http://j.mp/19uWgQf). Then you just need a ready-made Node JS app to sign your requests... How hard can that be?

Seriously, stick to the shallower waters. It gets crazy out here.
