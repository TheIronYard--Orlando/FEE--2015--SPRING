# 28 -- Getting Things Saved

## Description

We've spent the last couple lectures building pieces of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) for you in class using [Vue JS](http://vuejs.org) and (today) [Firebase](http://firebase.com). You may have seen this coming, but your task over the weekend is to build a fully-functional TodoMVC in groups... the _same_ groups from last time.

You've learned a lot since then. You've worked with different people and different tools. Now it's time to see what you can do.

**NOTE:** I do _NOT_ want to see any of _my_ code in your projects. If you don't understand it, comment it out, and do something you _do_ understand.

#### BEAST MODE

Persist the todo list in Firebase under a unique user account... Yes, that means you'll need to log them in, but there are [lots of options for authenticating users with Firebase](http://j.mp/1ALOsUy), and you can even use [Hello JS](http://j.mp/hellojs) to get more.

### Angular JS -- P90x Edition

Play through the [_Shaping Up with Angular JS_ course by Code School](http://j.mp/codeschool--angularjs) to get familiar with some of the sights and terms. Take notes, but speed through. Don't bother working through the exercises, just take the answers and type them exactly as presented. You'll spend more time on them next week.

When you're done, post a screen shot ([Skitch](https://evernote.com/skitch/) anyone?) of your completion badge in a comment on your _WIP Issue_.
