# 28 -- Getting Things Saved

## Description

We've spent the last couple lectures building pieces of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) for you in class using [Vue JS](http://vuejs.org) and (today) [Firebase](http://firebase.com). You may have seen this coming, but your task over the weekend is to build a fully-functional TodoMVC in groups... the _same_ groups from last time.

You've learned a lot since then. You've worked with different people and different tools. Now it's time to see what you can do.

  * `28 -- Getting Things Saved`
