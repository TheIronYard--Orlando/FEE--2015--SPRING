# 25 -- Build Me Something Beautiful

## Description

You have [a list of APIs](../APIs.md), two days, and two people. Build me something beautiful. I want to see your work -- planning, feature branches, PRs, pivots -- in a stand along repo named `TIY-Mashup`. Your final product should live in the `gh-pages` branch. Deploy often.

Some of the APIs on the list will require authentication. Some will _give_ you data anonymously, but you won't be able to _create_ data without authentication. Some public data will only be accessible via [JSONP](http://j.mp/1L4txz5) or a pre-shared key or secret. You'll have to figure out what you can and cannot do.

I want to see your team _plan first_. Sell me on an idea. Ping me on Slack. Get my input. Don't just start coding.
