Hint: look for the \"Raw\" button. You should end up with a bunch of checkboxes just like those below, thanks to [the way that Github interprets Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). As you complete tasks, check off the corresponding checkboxes. This is your **Work In Progress (WIP) Issue**.

If you _don't_ know how to touch type (i.e. without looking at the keyboard), start practicing _now_ with http://www.keybr.com/. If you're fairly confident in your typing ability, try working through the JavaScript lessons on http://typing.io\r\n\r\nAs I recommended to you in your interviews, there are two books that I suggest you start reading. They're both avaialble in digital format on various devices, and they're both relatively easy reads:\r\n\r\n* [_Getting Things Done_ by David Allen](http://j.mp/134jABk)\r\n* [_Pragmatic Thinking and Learning_ by Andy Hunt](http://j.mp/1D5nmu8)\r\n\r\nFinally, here are a couple of videos that I find inspirational and educational. We'll watch them again when class starts, but if you've got all this time on your hands:\r\n\r\n* [_The Growth Mindset_ by Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh0OS4MrN3E)\r\n* [Video Essays by Delve.TV](http://delve.tv/essays/)\r\n   * [_The Long Game_, part 1](http://delve.tv/the-long-game-part-one/)\r\n   * [_The Long Game_, part 2](http://delve.tv/the-long-game-part-2/)"
